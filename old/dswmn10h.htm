Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do NOT keep these books
in compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

<p>THE DESERTED WOMAN</p>

<p>by HONORE DE BALZAC</p>

<p><br>
 Translated By<br>
 Ellen Marriage</p>

<p>DEDICATION</p>

<p>To Her Grace the Duchesse d'Abrantes,<br>
 from her devoted servant,<br>
 Honore de Balzac.<br>
 PARIS, August 1835.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><br>
 THE DESERTED WOMAN</h1>

<h1> </h1>

<p>In the early spring of 1822, the Paris doctors sent to Lower
Normandy<br>
 a young man just recovering from an inflammatory complaint,
brought on<br>
 by overstudy, or perhaps by excess of some other kind. His<br>
 convalescence demanded complete rest, a light diet, bracing air,
and<br>
 freedom from excitement of every kind, and the fat lands of
Bessin<br>
 seemed to offer all these conditions of recovery. To Bayeux,
a<br>
 picturesque place about six miles from the sea, the patient
therefore<br>
 betook himself, and was received with the cordiality
characteristic of<br>
 relatives who lead very retired lives, and regard a new arrival
as a<br>
 godsend.</p>

<p><br>
 All little towns are alike, save for a few local customs. When
M. le<br>
 Baron Gaston de Nueil, the young Parisian in question, had spent
two<br>
 or three evenings in his cousin's house, or with the friends who
made<br>
 up Mme. de Sainte-Severe's circle, he very soon had made the<br>
 acquaintance of the persons whom this exclusive society
considered to<br>
 be "the whole town." Gaston de Nueil recognized in them the
invariable<br>
 stock characters which every observer finds in every one of the
many<br>
 capitals of the little States which made up the France of an
older<br>
 day.</p>

<p>First of all comes the family whose claims to nobility are
regarded as<br>
 incontestable, and of the highest antiquity in the department,
though<br>
 no one has so much as heard of them a bare fifty leagues away.
This<br>
 species of royal family on a small scale is distantly, but<br>
 unmistakably, connected with the Navarreins and the Grandlieu
family,<br>
 and related to the Cadignans, and the Blamont-Chauvrys. The head
of<br>
 the illustrious house is invariably a determined sportsman. He
has no<br>
 manners, crushes everybody else with his nominal
superiority,<br>
 tolerates the sub-prefect much as he submits to the taxes,
and<br>
 declines to acknowledge any of the novel powers created by
the<br>
 nineteenth century, pointing out to you as a political
monstrosity the<br>
 fact that the prime minister is a man of no birth. His wife
takes a<br>
 decided tone, and talks in a loud voice. She has had adorers in
her<br>
 time, but takes the sacrament regularly at Easter. She brings up
her<br>
 daughters badly, and is of the opinion that they will always be
rich<br>
 enough with their name.</p>

<p>Neither husband nor wife has the remotest idea of modern
luxury. They<br>
 retain a livery only seen elsewhere on the stage, and cling to
old<br>
 fashions in plate, furniture, and equipages, as in language and
manner<br>
 of life. This is a kind of ancient state, moreover, that
suits<br>
 passably well with provincial thrift. The good folk are, in
fact, the<br>
 lords of the manor of a bygone age, /minus/ the quitrents and
heriots,<br>
 the pack of hounds and the laced coats; full of honor among<br>
 themselves, and one and all loyally devoted to princes whom they
only<br>
 see at a distance. The historical house /incognito/ is as quaint
a<br>
 survival as a piece of ancient tapestry. Vegetating somewhere
among<br>
 them there is sure to be an uncle or a brother, a
lieutenant-general,<br>
 an old courtier of the Kings's, who wears the red ribbon of the
order<br>
 of Saint-Louis, and went to Hanover with the Marechal de
Richelieu:<br>
 and here you will find him like a stray leaf out of some old
pamphlet<br>
 of the time of Louis Quinze.</p>

<p>This fossil greatness finds a rival in another house,
wealthier,<br>
 though of less ancient lineage. Husband and wife spend a couple
of<br>
 months of every winter in Paris, bringing back with them its
frivolous<br>
 tone and short-lived contemporary crazes. Madame is a woman
of<br>
 fashion, though she looks rather conscious of her clothes, and
is<br>
 always behind the mode. She scoffs, however, at the ignorance
affected<br>
 by her neighbors. /Her/ plate is of modern fashion; she has
"grooms,"<br>
 Negroes, a valet-de-chambre, and what-not. Her oldest son drives
a<br>
 tilbury, and does nothing (the estate is entailed upon him),
his<br>
 younger brother is auditor to a Council of State. The father is
well<br>
 posted up in official scandals, and tells you anecdotes of
Louis<br>
 XVIII. and Madame du Cayla. He invests his money in the five
per<br>
 cents, and is careful to avoid the topic of cider, but has been
known<br>
 occasionally to fall a victim to the craze for rectifying
the<br>
 conjectural sums-total of the various fortunes of the
department. He<br>
 is a member of the Departmental Council, has his clothes from
Paris,<br>
 and wears the Cross of the Legion of Honor. In short, he is a
country<br>
 gentleman who has fully grasped the significance of the
Restoration,<br>
 and is coining money at the Chamber, but his Royalism is less
pure<br>
 than that of the rival house; he takes the /Gazette/ and the
/Debats/,<br>
 the other family only read the /Quotidienne/.</p>

<p>His lordship the Bishop, a sometime Vicar-General, fluctuates
between<br>
 the two powers, who pay him the respect due to religion, but at
times<br>
 they bring home to him the moral appended by the worthy
Lafontaine to<br>
 the fable of the /Ass laden with Relics/. The good man's origin
is<br>
 distinctly plebeian.</p>

<p>Then come stars of the second magnitude, men of family with
ten or<br>
 twelve hundred livres a year, captains in the navy or
cavalry<br>
 regiments, or nothing at all. Out on the roads, on horseback,
they<br>
 rank half-way between the cure bearing the sacraments and the
tax<br>
 collector on his rounds. Pretty nearly all of them have been in
the<br>
 Pages or in the Household Troops, and now are peaceably ending
their<br>
 days in a /faisance-valoir/, more interested in felling timber
and the<br>
 cider prospects than in the Monarchy.</p>

<p>Still they talk of the Charter and the Liberals while the
cards are<br>
 making, or over a game at backgammon, when they have exhausted
the<br>
 usual stock of /dots/, and have married everybody off according
to the<br>
 genealogies which they all know by heart. Their womenkind are
haughty<br>
 dames, who assume the airs of Court ladies in their basket
chaises.<br>
 They huddle themselves up in shawls and caps by way of full
dress; and<br>
 twice a year, after ripe deliberation, have a new bonnet from
Paris,<br>
 brought as opportunity offers. Exemplary wives are they for the
most<br>
 part, and garrulous.</p>

<p>These are the principal elements of aristocratic gentility,
with a few<br>
 outlying old maids of good family, spinsters who have solved
the<br>
 problem: given a human being, to remain absolutely stationary.
They<br>
 might be sealed up in the houses where you see them; their faces
and<br>
 their dresses are literally part of the fixtures of the town,
and the<br>
 province in which they dwell. They are its tradition, its
memory, its<br>
 quintessence, the /genius loci/ incarnate. There is something
frigid<br>
 and monumental about these ladies; they know exactly when to
laugh and<br>
 when to shake their heads, and every now and then give out
some<br>
 utterance which passes current as a witticism.</p>

<p>A few rich townspeople have crept into the miniature Faubourg
Saint-<br>
 Germain, thanks to their money or their aristocratic leanings.
But<br>
 despite their forty years, the circle still say of them, "Young
So-<br>
 and-so has sound opinions," and of such do they make deputies.
As a<br>
 rule, the elderly spinsters are their patronesses, not
without<br>
 comment.</p>

<p>Finally, in this exclusive little set include two or three<br>
 ecclesiastics, admitted for the sake of their cloth, or for
their wit;<br>
 for these great nobles find their own society rather dull,
and<br>
 introduce the bourgeois element into their drawing-rooms, as a
baker<br>
 puts leaven into his dough.</p>

<p>The sum-total contained by all heads put together consists of
a<br>
 certain quantity of antiquated notions; a few new inflections
brewed<br>
 in company of an evening being added from time to time to the
common<br>
 stock. Like sea-water in a little creek, the phrases which
represent<br>
 these ideas surge up daily, punctually obeying the tidal laws
of<br>
 conversation in their flow and ebb; you hear the hollow echo
of<br>
 yesterday, to-day, to-morrow, a year hence, and for evermore. On
all<br>
 things here below they pass immutable judgments, which go to
make up a<br>
 body of tradition into which no power of mortal man can infuse
one<br>
 drop of wit or sense. The lives of these persons revolve with
the<br>
 regularity of clockwork in an orbit of use and wont which admits
of no<br>
 more deviation or change than their opinions on matters
religious,<br>
 political, moral, or literary.</p>

<p>If a stranger is admitted to the /cenacle/, every member of it
in turn<br>
 will say (not without a trace of irony), "You will not find
the<br>
 brilliancy of your Parisian society here," and proceed forthwith
to<br>
 criticise the life led by his neighbors, as if he himself were
an<br>
 exception who had striven, and vainly striven, to enlighten the
rest.<br>
 But any stranger so ill advised as to concur in any of their
freely<br>
 expressed criticism of each other, is pronounced at once to be
an ill-<br>
 natured person, a heathen, an outlaw, a reprobate Parisian
"as<br>
 Parisians mostly are."</p>

<p>Before Gaston de Nueil made his appearance in this little
world of<br>
 strictly observed etiquette, where every detail of life is
an<br>
 integrant part of a whole, and everything is known; where the
values<br>
 of personalty and real estate is quoted like stocks on the vast
sheet<br>
 of the newspaper--before his arrival he had been weighed in
the<br>
 unerring scales of Bayeusaine judgment.</p>

<p>His cousin, Mme. de Sainte-Severe, had already given out the
amount of<br>
 his fortune, and the sum of his expectations, had produced the
family<br>
 tree, and expatiated on the talents, breeding, and modesty of
this<br>
 particular branch. So he received the precise amount of
attentions to<br>
 which he was entitled; he was accepted as a worthy scion of a
good<br>
 stock; and, for he was but twenty-three, was made welcome
without<br>
 ceremony, though certain young ladies and mothers of daughters
looked<br>
 not unkindly upon him.</p>

<p>He had an income of eighteen thousand livres from land in the
valley<br>
 of the Auge; and sooner or later his father, as in duty bound,
would<br>
 leave him the chateau of Manerville, with the lands
thereunto<br>
 belonging. As for his education, political career, personal
qualities,<br>
 and qualifications--no one so much as thought of raising the<br>
 questions. His land was undeniable, his rentals steady;
excellent<br>
 plantations had been made; the tenants paid for repairs, rates,
and<br>
 taxes; the apple-trees were thirty-eight years old; and, to
crown all,<br>
 his father was in treaty for two hundred acres of woodland
just<br>
 outside the paternal park, which he intended to enclose with
walls. No<br>
 hopes of a political career, no fame on earth, can compare with
such<br>
 advantages as these.</p>

<p>Whether out of malice or design, Mme. de Sainte-Severe omitted
to<br>
 mention that Gaston had an elder brother; nor did Gaston himself
say a<br>
 word about him. But, at the same time, it is true that the
brother was<br>
 consumptive, and to all appearance would shortly be laid in
earth,<br>
 lamented and forgotten.</p>

<p>At first Gaston de Nueil amused himself at the expense of the
circle.<br>
 He drew, as it were, for his mental album, a series of portraits
of<br>
 these folk, with their angular, wrinkled faces, and hooked
noses,<br>
 their crotchets and ludicrous eccentricities of dress, portraits
which<br>
 possessed all the racy flavor of truth. He delighted in
their<br>
 "Normanisms," in the primitive quaintness of their ideas and<br>
 characters. For a short time he flung himself into their
squirrel's<br>
 life of busy gyrations in a cage. Then he began to feel the want
of<br>
 variety, and grew tired of it. It was like the life of the
cloister,<br>
 cut short before it had well begun. He drifted on till he
reached a<br>
 crisis, which is neither spleen nor disgust, but combines all
the<br>
 symptoms of both. When a human being is transplanted into an<br>
 uncongenial soil, to lead a starved, stunted existence, there
is<br>
 always a little discomfort over the transition. Then, gradually,
if<br>
 nothing removes him from his surroundings, he grows accustomed
to<br>
 them, and adapts himself to the vacuity which grows upon him
and<br>
 renders him powerless. Even now, Gaston's lungs were accustomed
to the<br>
 air; and he was willing to discern a kind of vegetable happiness
in<br>
 days that brought no mental exertion and no responsibilities.
The<br>
 constant stirring of the sap of life, the fertilizing influences
of<br>
 mind on mind, after which he had sought so eagerly in Paris,
were<br>
 beginning to fade from his memory, and he was in a fair way
of<br>
 becoming a fossil with these fossils, and ending his days among
them,<br>
 content, like the companions of Ulysses, in his gross
envelope.</p>

<p><br>
 One evening Gaston de Nueil was seated between a dowager and one
of<br>
 the vicars-general of the diocese, in a gray-paneled
drawing-room,<br>
 floored with large white tiles. The family portraits which
adorned the<br>
 walls looked down upon four card-tables, and some sixteen
persons<br>
 gathered about them, chattering over their whist. Gaston,
thinking of<br>
 nothing, digesting one of those exquisite dinners to which
the<br>
 provincial looks forward all through the day, found himself
justifying<br>
 the customs of the country.</p>

<p>He began to understand why these good folk continued to play
with<br>
 yesterday's pack of cards and shuffle them on a threadbare
tablecloth,<br>
 and how it was that they had ceased to dress for themselves or
others.<br>
 He saw the glimmerings of something like a philosophy in the
even<br>
 tenor of their perpetual round, in the calm of their
methodical<br>
 monotony, in their ignorance of the refinements of luxury.
Indeed, he<br>
 almost came to think that luxury profited nothing; and even now,
the<br>
 city of Paris, with its passions, storms, and pleasures, was
scarcely<br>
 more than a memory of childhood.</p>

<p>He admired in all sincerity the red hands, and shy, bashful
manner of<br>
 some young lady who at first struck him as an awkward
simpleton,<br>
 unattractive to the last degree, and surprisingly ridiculous.
His doom<br>
 was sealed. He had gone from the provinces to Paris; he had led
the<br>
 feverish life of Paris; and now he would have sunk back into
the<br>
 lifeless life of the provinces, but for a chance remark which
reached<br>
 his ear--a few words that called up a swift rush of such emotion
as he<br>
 might have felt when a strain of really good music mingles with
the<br>
 accompaniment of some tedious opera.</p>

<p>"You went to call on Mme. de Beauseant yesterday, did you
not?" The<br>
 speaker was an elderly lady, and she addressed the head of the
local<br>
 royal family.</p>

<p>"I went this morning. She was so poorly and depressed, that I
could<br>
 not persuade her to dine with us to-morrow."</p>

<p>"With Mme. de Champignelles?" exclaimed the dowager with
something<br>
 like astonishment in her manner.</p>

<p>"With my wife," calmly assented the noble. "Mme. de Beauseant
is<br>
 descended from the House of Burgundy, on the spindle side, 'tis
true,<br>
 but the name atones for everything. My wife is very much
attached to<br>
 the Vicomtesse, and the poor lady has lived alone for such a
long<br>
 while, that----"</p>

<p>The Marquis de Champignelles looked round about him while he
spoke<br>
 with an air of cool unconcern, so that it was almost impossible
to<br>
 guess whether he made a concession to Mme. de Beauseant's
misfortunes,<br>
 or paid homage to her noble birth; whether he felt flattered
to<br>
 receive her in his house, or, on the contrary, sheer pride was
the<br>
 motive that led him to try to force the country families to meet
the<br>
 Vicomtesse.</p>

<p>The women appeared to take counsel of each other by a glance;
there<br>
 was a sudden silence in the room, and it was felt that their
attitude<br>
 was one of disapproval.</p>

<p>"Does this Mme. de Beauseant happen to be the lady whose
adventure<br>
 with M. d'Ajuda-Pinto made so much noise?" asked Gaston of
his<br>
 neighbor.</p>

<p>"The very same," he was told. "She came to Courcelles after
the<br>
 marriage of the Marquis d'Ajuda; nobody visits her. She has,
besides,<br>
 too much sense not to see that she is in a false position, so
she has<br>
 made no attempt to see any one. M. de Champignelles and a
few<br>
 gentlemen went to call upon her, but she would see no one but M.
de<br>
 Champignelles, perhaps because he is a connection of the family.
They<br>
 are related through the Beauseants; the father of the present
Vicomte<br>
 married a Mlle. de Champignelles of the older branch. But though
the<br>
 Vicomtesse de Beauseant is supposed to be a descendant of the
House of<br>
 Burgundy, you can understand that we could not admit a wife
separated<br>
 from her husband into our society here. We are foolish enough
still to<br>
 cling to these old-fashioned ideas. There was the less excuse
for the<br>
 Vicomtesse, because M. de Beauseant is a well-bred man of the
world,<br>
 who would have been quite ready to listen to reason. But his
wife is<br>
 quite mad----" and so forth and so forth.</p>

<p>M. de Nueil, still listening to the speaker's voice, gathered
nothing<br>
 of the sense of the words; his brain was too full of
thick-coming<br>
 fancies. Fancies? What other name can you give to the alluring
charms<br>
 of an adventure that tempts the imagination and sets vague
hopes<br>
 springing up in the soul; to the sense of coming events and
mysterious<br>
 felicity and fear at hand, while as yet there is no substance of
fact<br>
 on which these phantoms of caprice can fix and feed? Over
these<br>
 fancies thought hovers, conceiving impossible projects, giving
in the<br>
 germ all the joys of love. Perhaps, indeed, all passion is
contained<br>
 in that thought-germ, as the beauty, and fragrance, and rich
color of<br>
 the flower is all packed in the seed.</p>

<p>M. de Nueil did not know that Mme. de Beauseant had taken
refuge in<br>
 Normandy, after a notoriety which women for the most part envy
and<br>
 condemn, especially when youth and beauty in some sort excuse
the<br>
 transgression. Any sort of celebrity bestows an
inconceivable<br>
 prestige. Apparently for women, as for families, the glory of
the<br>
 crime effaces the stain; and if such and such a noble house is
proud<br>
 of its tale of heads that have fallen on the scaffold, a young
and<br>
 pretty woman becomes more interesting for the dubious renown of
a<br>
 happy love or a scandalous desertion, and the more she is to
be<br>
 pitied, the more she excites our sympathies. We are only
pitiless to<br>
 the commonplace. If, moreover, we attract all eyes, we are to
all<br>
 intents and purposes great; how, indeed, are we to be seen
unless we<br>
 raise ourselves above other people's heads? The common herd
of<br>
 humanity feels an involuntary respect for any person who can
rise<br>
 above it, and is not over-particular as to the means by which
they<br>
 rise.</p>

<p>It may have been that some such motives influenced Gaston de
Nueil at<br>
 unawares, or perhaps it was curiosity, or a craving for some
interest<br>
 in his life, or, in a word, that crowd of inexplicable impulses
which,<br>
 for want of a better name, we are wont to call "fatality," that
drew<br>
 him to Mme. de Beauseant.</p>

<p>The figure of the Vicomtesse de Beauseant rose up suddenly
before him<br>
 with gracious thronging associations. She was a new world for
him, a<br>
 world of fears and hopes, a world to fight for and to
conquer.<br>
 Inevitably he felt the contrast between this vision and the
human<br>
 beings in the shabby room; and then, in truth, she was a woman;
what<br>
 woman had he seen so far in this dull, little world, where
calculation<br>
 replaced thought and feeling, where courtesy was a
cut-and-dried<br>
 formality, and ideas of the very simplest were too alarming to
be<br>
 received or to pass current? The sound of Mme. de Beauseant's
name<br>
 revived a young man's dreams and wakened urgent desires that had
lain<br>
 dormant for a little.</p>

<p>Gaston de Nueil was absent-minded and preoccupied for the rest
of the<br>
 evening. He was pondering how he might gain access to Mme.
de<br>
 Beauseant, and truly it was no very easy matter. She was
believed to<br>
 be extremely clever. But if men and women of parts may be
captivated<br>
 by something subtle or eccentric, they are also exacting, and
can read<br>
 all that lies below the surface; and after the first step has
been<br>
 taken, the chances of failure and success in the difficult task
of<br>
 pleasing them are about even. In this particular case, moreover,
the<br>
 Vicomtesse, besides the pride of her position, had all the
dignity of<br>
 her name. Her utter seclusion was the least of the barriers
raised<br>
 between her and the world. For which reasons it was
well-nigh<br>
 impossible that a stranger, however well born, could hope
for<br>
 admittance; and yet, the next morning found M. de Nueil taking
his<br>
 walks abroad in the direction of Courcelles, a dupe of
illusions<br>
 natural at his age. Several times he made the circuit of the
garden<br>
 walls, looking earnestly through every gap at the closed
shutters or<br>
 open windows, hoping for some romantic chance, on which he
founded<br>
 schemes for introducing himself into this unknown lady's
presence,<br>
 without a thought of their impracticability. Morning after
morning was<br>
 spent in this way to mighty purpose; but with each day's walk,
that<br>
 vision of a woman living apart from the world, of love's martyr
buried<br>
 in solitude, loomed larger in his thoughts, and was enshrined in
his<br>
 soul. So Gaston de Nueil walked under the walls of Courcelles,
and<br>
 some gardener's heavy footstep would set his heart beating high
with<br>
 hope.</p>

<p>He thought of writing to Mme. de Beauseant, but on mature<br>
 consideration, what can you say to a woman whom you have never
seen, a<br>
 complete stranger? And Gaston had little self-confidence. Like
most<br>
 young persons with a plentiful crop of illusions still standing,
he<br>
 dreaded the mortifying contempt of silence more than death
itself, and<br>
 shuddered at the thought of sending his first tender epistle
forth to<br>
 face so many chances of being thrown on the fire. He was
distracted by<br>
 innumerable conflicting ideas. But by dint of inventing
chimeras,<br>
 weaving romances, and cudgeling his brains, he hit at last upon
one of<br>
 the hopeful stratagems that are sure to occur to your mind if
you<br>
 persevere long enough, a stratagem which must make clear to the
most<br>
 inexperienced woman that here was a man who took a fervent
interest in<br>
 her. The caprice of social conventions puts as many barriers
between<br>
 lovers as any Oriental imagination can devise in the most
delightfully<br>
 fantastic tale; indeed, the most extravagant pictures are
seldom<br>
 exaggerations. In real life, as in the fairy tales, the woman
belongs<br>
 to him who can reach her and set her free from the position in
which<br>
 she languishes. The poorest of calenders that ever fell in love
with<br>
 the daughter of the Khalif is in truth scarcely further from his
lady<br>
 than Gaston de Nueil from Mme. de Beauseant. The Vicomtesse
knew<br>
 absolutely nothing of M. de Nueil's wanderings round her house;
Gaston<br>
 de Nueil's love grew to the height of the obstacles to overleap;
and<br>
 the distance set between him and his extemporized lady-love
produced<br>
 the usual effect of distance, in lending enchantment.</p>

<p><br>
 One day, confident in his inspiration, he hoped everything from
the<br>
 love that must pour forth from his eyes. Spoken words, in his
opinion,<br>
 were more eloquent than the most passionate letter; and,
besides, he<br>
 would engage feminine curiosity to plead for him. He went,
therefore,<br>
 to M. de Champignelles, proposing to employ that gentleman for
the<br>
 better success of his enterprise. He informed the Marquis that
he had<br>
 been entrusted with a delicate and important commission
which<br>
 concerned the Vicomtesse de Beauseant, that he felt doubtful
whether<br>
 she would read a letter written in an unknown handwriting, or
put<br>
 confidence in a stranger. Would M. de Champignelles, on his
next<br>
 visit, ask the Vicomtesse if she would consent to receive
him--Gaston<br>
 de Nueil? While he asked the Marquis to keep his secret in case
of a<br>
 refusal, he very ingeniously insinuated sufficient reasons for
his own<br>
 admittance, to be duly passed on to the Vicomtesse. Was not M.
de<br>
 Champignelles a man of honor, a loyal gentleman incapable of
lending<br>
 himself to any transaction in bad taste, nay, the merest
suspicion of<br>
 bad taste! Love lends a young man all the self-possession and
astute<br>
 craft of an old ambassador; all the Marquis' harmless vanities
were<br>
 gratified, and the haughty grandee was completely duped. He
tried hard<br>
 to fathom Gaston's secret; but the latter, who would have been
greatly<br>
 perplexed to tell it, turned off M. de Champignelles' adroit<br>
 questioning with a Norman's shrewdness, till the Marquis, as a
gallant<br>
 Frenchman, complimented his young visitor upon his
discretion.</p>

<p>M. de Champignelles hurried off at once to Courcelles, with
that<br>
 eagerness to serve a pretty woman which belongs to his time of
life.<br>
 In the Vicomtesse de Beauseant's position, such a message was
likely<br>
 to arouse keen curiosity; so, although her memory supplied no
reason<br>
 at all that could bring M. de Nueil to her house, she saw no
objection<br>
 to his visit--after some prudent inquiries as to his family
and<br>
 condition. At the same time, she began by a refusal. Then
she<br>
 discussed the propriety of the matter with M. de
Champignelles,<br>
 directing her questions so as to discover, if possible, whether
he<br>
 knew the motives for the visit, and finally revoked her
negative<br>
 answer. The discussion and the discretion shown perforce by
the<br>
 Marquis had piqued her curiosity.</p>

<p>M. de Champignelles had no mind to cut a ridiculous figure. He
said,<br>
 with the air of a man who can keep another's counsel, that
the<br>
 Vicomtesse must know the purpose of this visit perfectly well;
while<br>
 the Vicomtesse, in all sincerity, had no notion what it could
be. Mme.<br>
 de Beauseant, in perplexity, connected Gaston with people whom
he had<br>
 never met, went astray after various wild conjectures, and
asked<br>
 herself if she had seen this M. de Nueil before. In truth, no
love-<br>
 letter, however sincere or skilfully indited, could have
produced so<br>
 much effect as this riddle. Again and again Mme. de Beauseant
puzzled<br>
 over it.</p>

<p>When Gaston heard that he might call upon the Vicomtesse, his
rapture<br>
 at so soon obtaining the ardently longed-for good fortune was
mingled<br>
 with singular embarrassment. How was he to contrive a suitable
sequel<br>
 to this stratagem?</p>

<p>"Bah! I shall see /her/," he said over and over again to
himself as he<br>
 dressed. "See her, and that is everything!"</p>

<p>He fell to hoping that once across the threshold of Courcelles
he<br>
 should find an expedient for unfastening this Gordian knot of
his own<br>
 tying. There are believers in the omnipotence of necessity who
never<br>
 turn back; the close presence of danger is an inspiration that
calls<br>
 out all their powers for victory. Gaston de Nueil was one of
these.</p>

<p>He took particular pains with his dress, imagining, as youth
is apt to<br>
 imagine, that success or failure hangs on the position of a
curl, and<br>
 ignorant of the fact that anything is charming in youth. And, in
any<br>
 case, such women as Mme. de Beauseant are only attracted by the
charms<br>
 of wit or character of an unusual order. Greatness of
character<br>
 flatters their vanity, promises a great passion, seems to imply
a<br>
 comprehension of the requirements of their hearts. Wit amuses
them,<br>
 responds to the subtlety of their natures, and they think that
they<br>
 are understood. And what do all women wish but to be amused,<br>
 understood, or adored? It is only after much reflection on the
things<br>
 of life that we understand the consummate coquetry of neglect of
dress<br>
 and reserve at a first interview; and by the time we have
gained<br>
 sufficient astuteness for successful strategy, we are too old
to<br>
 profit by our experience.</p>

<p>While Gaston's lack of confidence in his mental equipment
drove him to<br>
 borrow charms from his clothes, Madame de Beauseant herself
was<br>
 instinctively giving more attention to her toilette.</p>

<p>"I would rather not frighten people, at all events," she said
to<br>
 herself as she arranged her hair.</p>

<p>In M. de Nueil's character, person, and manner there was that
touch of<br>
 unconscious originality which gives a kind of flavor to things
that<br>
 any one might say or do, and absolves everything that they may
choose<br>
 to do or say. He was highly cultivated, he had a keen brain, and
a<br>
 face, mobile as his own nature, which won the goodwill of
others. The<br>
 promise of passion and tenderness in the bright eyes was
fulfilled by<br>
 an essentially kindly heart. The resolution which he made as
he<br>
 entered the house at Courcelles was in keeping with his frank
nature<br>
 and ardent imagination. But, bold has he was with love, his
heart beat<br>
 violently when he had crossed the great court, laid out like
an<br>
 English garden, and the man-servant, who had taken his name to
the<br>
 Vicomtesse, returned to say that she would receive him.</p>

<p>"M. le Baron de Nueil."</p>

<p>Gaston came in slowly, but with sufficient ease of manner; and
it is a<br>
 more difficult thing, be it said, to enter a room where there is
but<br>
 one woman, than a room that holds a score.</p>

<p>A great fire was burning on the hearth in spite of the mild
weather,<br>
 and by the soft light of the candles in the sconces he saw a
young<br>
 woman sitting on a high-backed /bergere/ in the angle by the
hearth.<br>
 The seat was so low that she could move her head freely; every
turn of<br>
 it was full of grace and delicate charm, whether she bent,
leaning<br>
 forward, or raised and held it erect, slowly and languidly, as
though<br>
 it were a heavy burden, so low that she could cross her feet and
let<br>
 them appear, or draw them back under the folds of a long black
dress.</p>

<p>The Vicomtesse made as if she would lay the book that she was
reading<br>
 on a small, round stand; but as she did so, she turned towards
M. de<br>
 Nueil, and the volume, insecurely laid upon the edge, fell to
the<br>
 ground between the stand and the sofa. This did not seem to
disconcert<br>
 her. She looked up, bowing almost imperceptibly in response to
his<br>
 greeting, without rising from the depths of the low chair in
which she<br>
 lay. Bending forwards, she stirred the fire briskly, and stooped
to<br>
 pick up a fallen glove, drawing it mechanically over her left
hand,<br>
 while her eyes wandered in search of its fellow. The glance
was<br>
 instantly checked, however, for she stretched out a thin, white,
all-<br>
 but-transparent right hand, with flawless ovals of rose-colored
nail<br>
 at the tips of the slender, ringless fingers, and pointed to a
chair<br>
 as if to bid Gaston be seated. He sat down, and she turned her
face<br>
 questioningly towards him. Words cannot describe the subtlety of
the<br>
 winning charm and inquiry in that gesture; deliberate in its<br>
 kindliness, gracious yet accurate in expression, it was the
outcome of<br>
 early education and of a constant use and wont of the
graciousness of<br>
 life. These movements of hers, so swift, so deft, succeeded each
other<br>
 by the blending of a pretty woman's fastidious carelessness with
the<br>
 high-bred manner of a great lady.</p>

<p>Mme. de Beauseant stood out in such strong contrast against
the<br>
 automatons among whom he had spent two months of exile in that
out-of-<br>
 the-world district of Normandy, that he could not but find in
her the<br>
 realization of his romantic dreams; and, on the other hand, he
could<br>
 not compare her perfections with those of other women whom he
had<br>
 formerly admired. Here in her presence, in a drawing-room like
some<br>
 salon in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, full of costly trifles
lying<br>
 about upon the tables, and flowers and books, he felt as if he
were<br>
 back in Paris. It was a real Parisian carpet beneath his feet,
he saw<br>
 once more the high-bred type of Parisienne, the fragile outlines
of<br>
 her form, her exquisite charm, her disdain of the studied
effects<br>
 which did so much to spoil provincial women.</p>

<p>Mme. de Beauseant had fair hair and dark eyes, and the pale
complexion<br>
 that belongs to fair hair. She held up her brow nobly like some
fallen<br>
 angel, grown proud through the fall, disdainful of pardon. Her
way of<br>
 gathering her thick hair into a crown of plaits above the
broad,<br>
 curving lines of the bandeaux upon her forehead, added to
the<br>
 queenliness of her face. Imagination could discover the ducal
coronet<br>
 of Burgundy in the spiral threads of her golden hair; all the
courage<br>
 of her house seemed to gleam from the great lady's brilliant
eyes,<br>
 such courage as women use to repel audacity or scorn, for they
were<br>
 full of tenderness for gentleness. The outline of that little
head, so<br>
 admirably poised above the long, white throat, the delicate,
fine<br>
 features, the subtle curves of the lips, the mobile face itself,
wore<br>
 an expression of delicate discretion, a faint semblance of
irony<br>
 suggestive of craft and insolence. Yet it would have been
difficult to<br>
 refuse forgiveness to those two feminine failings in her; for
the<br>
 lines that came out in her forehead whenever her face was not
in<br>
 repose, like her upward glances (that pathetic trick of manner),
told<br>
 unmistakably of unhappiness, of a passion that had all but cost
her<br>
 her life. A woman, sitting in the great, silent salon, a woman
cut off<br>
 from the rest of the world in this remote little valley, alone,
with<br>
 the memories of her brilliant, happy, and impassioned youth,
of<br>
 continual gaiety and homage paid on all sides, now replaced by
the<br>
 horrors of the void--was there not something in the sight to
strike<br>
 awe that deepened with reflection? Consciousness of her own
value<br>
 lurked in her smile. She was neither wife nor mother, she was
an<br>
 outlaw; she had lost the one heart that could set her pulses
beating<br>
 without shame; she had nothing from without to support her
reeling<br>
 soul; she must even look for strength from within, live her own
life,<br>
 cherish no hope save that of forsaken love, which looks forward
to<br>
 Death's coming, and hastens his lagging footsteps. And this
while life<br>
 was in its prime. Oh! to feel destined for happiness and to
die--never<br>
 having given nor received it! A woman too! What pain was this!
These<br>
 thoughts flashing across M. de Nueil's mind like lightning, left
him<br>
 very humble in the presence of the greatest charm with which
woman can<br>
 be invested. The triple aureole of beauty, nobleness, and
misfortune<br>
 dazzled him; he stood in dreamy, almost open-mouthed admiration
of the<br>
 Vicomtesse. But he found nothing to say to her.</p>

<p>Mme. de Beauseant, by no means displeased, no doubt, by his
surprise,<br>
 held out her hand with a kindly but imperious gesture; then,
summoning<br>
 a smile to her pale lips, as if obeying, even yet, the woman's
impulse<br>
 to be gracious:</p>

<p>"I have heard from M. de Champignelles of a message which you
have<br>
 kindly undertaken to deliver, monsieur," she said. "Can it
be<br>
 from----"</p>

<p>With that terrible phrase Gaston understood, even more clearly
than<br>
 before, his own ridiculous position, the bad taste and bad faith
of<br>
 his behavior towards a woman so noble and so unfortunate. He
reddened.<br>
 The thoughts that crowded in upon him could be read in his
troubled<br>
 eyes; but suddenly, with the courage which youth draws from a
sense of<br>
 its own wrongdoing, he gained confidence, and very humbly
interrupted<br>
 Mme. de Beauseant.</p>

<p>"Madame," he faltered out, "I do not deserve the happiness of
seeing<br>
 you. I have deceived you basely. However strong the motive may
have<br>
 been, it can never excuse the pitiful subterfuge which I used to
gain<br>
 my end. But, madame, if your goodness will permit me to tell
you----"</p>

<p>The Vicomtesse glanced at M. de Nueil, haughty disdain in her
whole<br>
 manner. She stretched her hand to the bell and rang it.</p>

<p>"Jacques," she said, "light this gentleman to the door," and
she<br>
 looked with dignity at the visitor.</p>

<p>She rose proudly, bowed to Gaston, and then stooped for the
fallen<br>
 volume. If all her movements on his entrance had been
caressingly<br>
 dainty and gracious, her every gesture now was no less
severely<br>
 frigid. M. de Nueil rose to his feet, but he stood waiting. Mme.
de<br>
 Beauseant flung another glance at him. "Well, why do you not
go?" she<br>
 seemed to say.</p>

<p>There was such cutting irony in that glance that Gaston grew
white as<br>
 if he were about to faint. Tears came into his eyes, but he
would not<br>
 let them fall, and scorching shame and despair dried them. He
looked<br>
 back at Madame de Beauseant, and a certain pride and
consciousness of<br>
 his own worth was mingled with his humility; the Vicomtesse had
a<br>
 right to punish him, but ought she to use her right? Then he
went out.</p>

<p>As he crossed the ante-chamber, a clear head, and wits
sharpened by<br>
 passion, were not slow to grasp the danger of his situation.</p>

<p>"If I leave this house, I can never come back to it again," he
said to<br>
 himself. "The Vicomtesse will always think of me as a fool. It
is<br>
 impossible that a woman, and such a woman, should not guess the
love<br>
 that she has called forth. Perhaps she feels a little,
vague,<br>
 involuntary regret for dismissing me so abruptly.--But she could
not<br>
 do otherwise, and she cannot recall her sentence. It rests with
me to<br>
 understand her."</p>

<p>At that thought Gaston stopped short on the flight of steps
with an<br>
 exclamation; he turned sharply, saying, "I have forgotten
something,"<br>
 and went back to the salon. The lackey, all respect for a baron
and<br>
 the rights of property, was completely deceived by the
natural<br>
 utterance, and followed him. Gaston returned quietly and
unannounced.<br>
 The Vicomtesse, thinking that the intruder was the servant,
looked up<br>
 and beheld M. de Nueil.</p>

<p>"Jacques lighted me to the door," he said, with a half-sad
smile which<br>
 dispelled any suspicion of jest in those words, while the tone
in<br>
 which they were spoken went to the heart. Mme. de Beauseant
was<br>
 disarmed.</p>

<p>"Very well, take a seat," she said.</p>

<p>Gaston eagerly took possession of a chair. His eyes were
shining with<br>
 happiness; the Vicomtesse, unable to endure the brilliant light
in<br>
 them, looked down at the book. She was enjoying a delicious,
ever new<br>
 sensation; the sense of a man's delight in her presence is
an<br>
 unfailing feminine instinct. And then, besides, he had divined
her,<br>
 and a woman is so grateful to the man who has mastered the
apparently<br>
 capricious, yet logical, reasoning of her heart; who can track
her<br>
 thought through the seemingly contradictory workings of her
mind, and<br>
 read the sensations, shy or bold, written in fleeting red, a<br>
 bewildering maze of coquetry and self-revelation.</p>

<p>"Madame," Gaston exclaimed in a low voice, "my blunder you
know, but<br>
 you do not know how much I am to blame. If you only knew what
joy it<br>
 was to----"</p>

<p>"Ah! take care," she said, holding up one finger with an air
of<br>
 mystery, as she put out her hand towards the bell.</p>

<p>The charming gesture, the gracious threat, no doubt called up
some sad<br>
 thought, some memory of the old happy time when she could be
wholly<br>
 charming and gentle without an afterthought; when the gladness
of her<br>
 heart justified every caprice, and put charm into every
least<br>
 movement. The lines in her forehead gathered between her brows,
and<br>
 the expression of her face grew dark in the soft candle-light.
Then<br>
 looking across at M. de Nueil gravely but not unkindly, she
spoke like<br>
 a woman who deeply feels the meaning of every word.</p>

<p>"This is all very ridiculous! Once upon a time, monsieur,
when<br>
 thoughtless high spirits were my privilege, I should have
laughed<br>
 fearlessly over your visit with you. But now my life is very
much<br>
 changed. I cannot do as I like, I am obliged to think. What
brings you<br>
 here? Is it curiosity? In that case I am paying dearly for a
little<br>
 fleeting pleasure. Have you fallen /passionately/ in love
already with<br>
 a woman whom you have never seen, a woman with whose name
slander has,<br>
 of course, been busy? If so, your motive in making this visit is
based<br>
 on disrespect, on an error which accident brought into
notoriety."</p>

<p>She flung her book down scornfully upon the table, then, with
a<br>
 terrible look at Gaston, she went on: "Because I once was weak,
must<br>
 it be supposed that I am always weak? This is horrible,
degrading. Or<br>
 have you come here to pity me? You are very young to offer
sympathy<br>
 with heart troubles. Understand this clearly, sir, that I would
rather<br>
 have scorn than pity. I will not endure compassion from any
one."</p>

<p>There was a brief pause.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," she continued (and the face that she turned to
him was<br>
 gentle and sad), "whatever motive induced this rash intrusion
upon my<br>
 solitude, it is very painful to me, you see. You are too young
to be<br>
 totally without good feeling, so surely you will feel that
this<br>
 behavior of yours is improper. I forgive you for it, and, as you
see,<br>
 I am speaking of it to you without bitterness. You will not come
here<br>
 again, will you? I am entreating when I might command. If you
come to<br>
 see me again, neither you nor I can prevent the whole place
from<br>
 believing that you are my lover, and you would cause me
great<br>
 additional annoyance. You do not mean to do that, I think."</p>

<br>
She said no more, but looked at him with a great dignity which
abashed<br>
him. 

<p>"I have done wrong, madame," he said, with deep feeling in his
voice,<br>
 "but it was through enthusiasm and thoughtlessness and eager
desire of<br>
 happiness, the qualities and defects of my age. Now, I
understand that<br>
 I ought not to have tried to see you," he added; "but, at the
same<br>
 time, the desire was a very natural one"--and, making an appeal
to<br>
 feeling rather than to the intellect, he described the weariness
of<br>
 his enforced exile. He drew a portrait of a young man in whom
the<br>
 fires of life were burning themselves out, conveying the
impression<br>
 that here was a heart worthy of tender love, a heart which,<br>
 notwithstanding, had never known the joys of love for a young
and<br>
 beautiful woman of refinement and taste. He explained,
without<br>
 attempting to justify, his unusual conduct. He flattered Mme.
de<br>
 Beauseant by showing that she had realized for him the ideal
lady of a<br>
 young man's dream, the ideal sought by so many, and so often
sought in<br>
 vain. Then he touched upon his morning prowlings under the walls
of<br>
 Courcelles, and his wild thoughts at the first sight of the
house,<br>
 till he excited that vague feeling of indulgence which a woman
can<br>
 find in her heart for the follies committed for her sake.</p>

<p>An impassioned voice was speaking in the chill solitude; the
speaker<br>
 brought with him a warm breath of youth and the charms of a
carefully<br>
 cultivated mind. It was so long since Mme. de Beauseant had
felt<br>
 stirred by real feeling delicately expressed, that it affected
her<br>
 very strongly now. In spite of herself, she watched M. de
Nueil's<br>
 expressive face, and admired the noble countenance of a soul,
unbroken<br>
 as yet by the cruel discipline of the life of the world,
unfretted by<br>
 continual scheming to gratify personal ambition and vanity.
Gaston was<br>
 in the flower of his youth, he impressed her as a man with
something<br>
 in him, unaware as yet of the great career that lay before him.
So<br>
 both these two made reflections most dangerous for their peace
of<br>
 mind, and both strove to conceal their thoughts. M. de Nueil saw
in<br>
 the Vicomtesse a rare type of woman, always the victim of
her<br>
 perfections and tenderness; her graceful beauty is the least of
her<br>
 charms for those who are privileged to know the infinite of
feeling<br>
 and thought and goodness in the soul within; a woman whose
instinctive<br>
 feeling for beauty runs through all the most varied expressions
of<br>
 love, purifying its transports, turning them to something almost
holy;<br>
 wonderful secret of womanhood, the exquisite gift that Nature
so<br>
 seldom bestows. And the Vicomtesse, on her side, listening to
the ring<br>
 of sincerity in Gaston's voice, while he told of his
youthful<br>
 troubles, began to understand all that grown children of
five-and-<br>
 twenty suffer from diffidence, when hard work has kept them
alike from<br>
 corrupting influences and intercourse with men and women of the
world<br>
 whose sophistical reasoning and experience destroys the fair
qualities<br>
 of youth. Here was the ideal of a woman's dreams, a man
unspoiled as<br>
 yet by the egoism of family or success, or by that narrow
selfishness<br>
 which blights the first impulses of honor, devotion,
self-sacrifice,<br>
 and high demands of self; all the flowers so soon wither that
enrich<br>
 at first the life of delicate but strong emotions, and keep
alive the<br>
 loyalty of the heart.</p>

<p>But these two, once launched forth into the vast of sentiment,
went<br>
 far indeed in theory, sounding the depths in either soul,
testing the<br>
 sincerity of their expressions; only, whereas Gaston's
experiments<br>
 were made unconsciously, Mme. de Beauseant had a purpose in all
that<br>
 she said. Bringing her natural and acquired subtlety to the
work, she<br>
 sought to learn M. de Nueil's opinions by advancing, as far as
she<br>
 could do so, views diametrically opposed to her own. So witty
and so<br>
 gracious was she, so much herself with this stranger, with whom
she<br>
 felt completely at ease, because she felt sure that they should
never<br>
 meet again, that, after some delicious epigram of hers,
Gaston<br>
 exclaimed unthinkingly:</p>

<p>"Oh! madame, how could any man have left you?"</p>

<p>The Vicomtesse was silent. Gaston reddened, he thought that he
had<br>
 offended her; but she was not angry. The first deep thrill of
delight<br>
 since the day of her calamity had taken her by surprise. The
skill of<br>
 the cleverest /roue/ could not have made the impression that M.
de<br>
 Nueil made with that cry from the heart. That verdict wrung from
a<br>
 young man's candor gave her back innocence in her own eyes,
condemned<br>
 the world, laid the blame upon the lover who had left her,
and<br>
 justified her subsequent solitary drooping life. The world's<br>
 absolution, the heartfelt sympathy, the social esteem so longed
for,<br>
 and so harshly refused, nay, all her secret desires were given
her to<br>
 the full in that exclamation, made fairer yet by the heart's
sweetest<br>
 flatteries and the admiration that women always relish eagerly.
He<br>
 understood her, understood all, and he had given her, as if it
were<br>
 the most natural thing in the world, the opportunity of rising
higher<br>
 through her fall. She looked at the clock.</p>

<p>"Ah! madame, do not punish me for my heedlessness. If you
grant me but<br>
 one evening, vouchsafe not to shorten it."</p>

<p>She smiled at the pretty speech.</p>

<p>"Well, as we must never meet again," she said, "what signifies
a<br>
 moment more or less? If you were to care for me, it would be a
pity."</p>

<p>"It is too late now," he said.</p>

<p>"Do not tell me that," she answered gravely. "Under any
other<br>
 circumstances I should be very glad to see you. I will speak
frankly,<br>
 and you will understand how it is that I do not choose to see
you<br>
 again, and ought not to do so. You have too much magnanimity not
to<br>
 feel that if I were so much as suspected of a second trespass,
every<br>
 one would think of me as a contemptible and vulgar woman; I
should be<br>
 like other women. A pure and blameless life will bring my
character<br>
 into relief. I am too proud not to endeavor to live like one
apart in<br>
 the world, a victim of the law through my marriage, man's
victim<br>
 through my love. If I were not faithful to the position which I
have<br>
 taken up, then I should deserve all the reproach that is heaped
upon<br>
 me; I should be lowered in my own eyes. I had not enough lofty
social<br>
 virtue to remain with a man whom I did not love. I have snapped
the<br>
 bonds of marriage in spite of the law; it was wrong, it was a
crime,<br>
 it was anything you like, but for me the bonds meant death. I
meant to<br>
 live. Perhaps if I had been a mother I could have endured the
torture<br>
 of a forced marriage of suitability. At eighteen we scarcely
know what<br>
 is done with us, poor girls that we are! I have broken the laws
of the<br>
 world, and the world has punished me; we both did rightly. I
sought<br>
 happiness. Is it not a law of our nature to seek for happiness?
I was<br>
 young, I was beautiful . . . I thought that I had found a nature
as<br>
 loving, as apparently passionate. I was loved indeed; for a
little<br>
 while . . ."</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>"I used to think," she said, "that no one could leave a woman
in such<br>
 a position as mine. I have been forsaken; I must have offended
in some<br>
 way. Yes, in some way, no doubt, I failed to keep some law of
our<br>
 nature, was too loving, too devoted, too exacting--I do not
know. Evil<br>
 days have brought light with them! For a long while I blamed
another,<br>
 now I am content to bear the whole blame. At my own expense, I
have<br>
 absolved that other of whom I once thought I had a right to
complain.<br>
 I had not the art to keep him; fate has punished me heavily for
my<br>
 lack of skill. I only knew how to love; how can one keep oneself
in<br>
 mind when one loves? So I was a slave when I should have sought
to be<br>
 a tyrant. Those who know me may condemn me, but they will
respect me<br>
 too. Pain has taught me that I must not lay myself open to this
a<br>
 second time. I cannot understand how it is that I am living yet,
after<br>
 the anguish of that first week of the most fearful crisis in a
woman's<br>
 life. Only from three years of loneliness would it be possible
to draw<br>
 strength to speak of that time as I am speaking now. Such
agony,<br>
 monsieur, usually ends in death; but this--well, it was the
agony of<br>
 death with no tomb to end it. Oh! I have known pain indeed!"</p>

<p>The Vicomtesse raised her beautiful eyes to the ceiling; and
the<br>
 cornice, no doubt, received all the confidences which a stranger
might<br>
 not hear. When a woman is afraid to look at her interlocutor,
there is<br>
 in truth no gentler, meeker, more accommodating confidant than
the<br>
 cornice. The cornice is quite an institution in the boudoir;
what is<br>
 it but the confessional, /minus/ the priest?</p>

<p>Mme. de Beauseant was eloquent and beautiful at that moment;
nay,<br>
 "coquettish," if the word were not too heavy. By justifying
herself<br>
 and love, she was stimulating every sentiment in the man before
her;<br>
 nay, more, the higher she set the goal, the more conspicuous it
grew.<br>
 At last, when her eyes had lost the too eloquent expression
given to<br>
 them by painful memories, she let them fall on Gaston.</p>

<p>"You acknowledge, do you not, that I am bound to lead a
solitary,<br>
 self-contained life?" she said quietly.</p>

<p>So sublime was she in her reasoning and her madness, that M.
de Nueil<br>
 felt a wild longing to throw himself at her feet; but he was
afraid of<br>
 making himself ridiculous, so he held his enthusiasm and his
thoughts<br>
 in check. He was afraid, too, that he might totally fail to
express<br>
 them, and in no less terror of some awful rejection on her part,
or of<br>
 her mockery, an apprehension which strikes like ice to the most
fervid<br>
 soul. The revulsion which led him to crush down every feeling as
it<br>
 sprang up in his heart cost him the intense pain that diffident
and<br>
 ambitious natures experience in the frequent crises when they
are<br>
 compelled to stifle their longings. And yet, in spite of
himself, he<br>
 broke the silence to say in a faltering voice:</p>

<p>"Madame, permit me to give way to one of the strongest
emotions of my<br>
 life, and own to all that you have made me feel. You set the
heart in<br>
 me swelling high! I feel within me a longing to make you forget
your<br>
 mortifications, to devote my life to this, to give you love for
all<br>
 who ever have given you wounds or hate. But this is a very
sudden<br>
 outpouring of the heart, nothing can justify it to-day, and I
ought<br>
 not----"</p>

<p>"Enough, monsieur," said Mme. de Beauseant; "we have both of
us gone<br>
 too far. By giving you the sad reasons for a refusal which I
am<br>
 compelled to give, I meant to soften it and not to elicit
homage.<br>
 Coquetry only suits a happy woman. Believe me, we must
remain<br>
 strangers to each other. At a later day you will know that ties
which<br>
 must inevitably be broken ought not to be formed at all."</p>

<p>She sighed lightly, and her brows contracted, but almost
immediately<br>
 grew clear again.</p>

<p>"How painful it is for a woman to be powerless to follow the
man she<br>
 loves through all the phases of his life! And if that man loves
her<br>
 truly, his heart must surely vibrate with pain to the deep
trouble in<br>
 hers. Are they not twice unhappy?"</p>

<p>There was a short pause. Then she rose smiling.</p>

<p>"You little suspected, when you came to Courcelles, that you
were to<br>
 hear a sermon, did you?"</p>

<p>Gaston felt even further than at first from this extraordinary
woman.<br>
 Was the charm of that delightful hour due after all to the
coquetry of<br>
 the mistress of the house? She had been anxious to display her
wit. He<br>
 bowed stiffly to the Vicomtesse, and went away in
desperation.</p>

<p>On the way home he tried to detect the real character of a
creature<br>
 supple and hard as a steel spring; but he had seen her pass
through so<br>
 many phases, that he could not make up his mind about her. The
tones<br>
 of her voice, too, were ringing in his ears; her gestures, the
little<br>
 movements of her head, and the varying expression of her eyes
grew<br>
 more gracious in memory, more fascinating as he thought of them.
The<br>
 Vicomtesse's beauty shone out again for him in the darkness;
his<br>
 reviving impressions called up yet others, and he was enthralled
anew<br>
 by womanly charm and wit, which at first he had not perceived.
He fell<br>
 to wandering musings, in which the most lucid thoughts grow
refractory<br>
 and flatly contradict each other, and the soul passes through a
brief<br>
 frenzy fit. Youth only can understand all that lies in the
dithyrambic<br>
 outpourings of youth when, after a stormy siege, of the most
frantic<br>
 folly and coolest common-sense, the heart finally yields to
the<br>
 assault of the latest comer, be it hope, or despair, as some<br>
 mysterious power determines.</p>

<p>At three-and-twenty, diffidence nearly always rules a man's
conduct;<br>
 he is perplexed with a young girl's shyness, a girl's trouble;
he is<br>
 afraid lest he should express his love ill, sees nothing but<br>
 difficulties, and takes alarm at them; he would be bolder if he
loved<br>
 less, for he has no confidence in himself, and with a growing
sense of<br>
 the cost of happiness comes a conviction that the woman he
loves<br>
 cannot easily be won; perhaps, too, he is giving himself up
too<br>
 entirely to his own pleasure, and fears that he can give none;
and<br>
 when, for his misfortune, his idol inspires him with awe, he
worships<br>
 in secret and afar, and unless his love is guessed, it dies
away. Then<br>
 it often happens that one of these dead early loves lingers on,
bright<br>
 with illusions in many a young heart. What man is there but
keeps<br>
 within him these virgin memories that grow fairer every time
they rise<br>
 before him, memories that hold up to him the ideal of perfect
bliss?<br>
 Such recollections are like children who die in the flower
of<br>
 childhood, before their parents have known anything of them but
their<br>
 smiles.</p>

<p>So M. de Nueil came home from Courcelles, the victim of a mood
fraught<br>
 with desperate resolutions. Even now he felt that Mme. de
Beauseant<br>
 was one of the conditions of his existence, and that death would
be<br>
 preferable to life without her. He was still young enough to
feel the<br>
 tyrannous fascination which fully-developed womanhood exerts
over<br>
 immature and impassioned natures; and, consequently, he was to
spend<br>
 one of those stormy nights when a young man's thoughts travel
from<br>
 happiness to suicide and back again--nights in which youth
rushes<br>
 through a lifetime of bliss and falls asleep from sheer
exhaustion.<br>
 Fateful nights are they, and the worst misfortune that can
happen is<br>
 to awake a philosopher afterwards. M. de Nueil was far too
deeply in<br>
 love to sleep; he rose and betook to inditing letters, but none
of<br>
 them were satisfactory, and he burned them all.</p>

<p>The next day he went to Courcelles to make the circuit of her
garden<br>
 walls, but he waited till nightfall; he was afraid that she
might see<br>
 him. The instinct that led him to act in this way arose out of
so<br>
 obscure a mood of the soul, that none but a young man, or a man
in<br>
 like case, can fully understand its mute ecstasies and its
vagaries,<br>
 matter to set those people who are lucky enough to see life only
in<br>
 its matter-of-fact aspect shrugging their shoulders. After
painful<br>
 hesitation, Gaston wrote to Mme. de Beauseant. Here is the
letter,<br>
 which may serve as a sample of the epistolary style peculiar
to<br>
 lovers, a performance which, like the drawings prepared with
great<br>
 secrecy by children for the birthdays of father or mother, is
found<br>
 insufferable by every mortal except the recipients:--</p>

<p>"MADAME,--Your power over my heart, my soul, myself, is so
great<br>
 that my fate depends wholly upon you to-day. Do not throw
this<br>
 letter into the fire; be so kind as to read it through.
Perhaps<br>
 you may pardon the opening sentence when you see that it is
no<br>
 commonplace, selfish declaration, but that it expresses a
simple<br>
 fact. Perhaps you may feel moved, because I ask for so little,
by<br>
 the submission of one who feels himself so much beneath you,
by<br>
 the influence that your decision will exercise upon my life. At
my<br>
 age, madame, I only know how to love, I am utterly ignorant
of<br>
 ways of attracting and winning a woman's love, but in my own
heart<br>
 I know raptures of adoration of her. I am irresistibly drawn
to<br>
 you by the great happiness that I feel through you; my
thoughts<br>
 turn to you with the selfish instinct which bids us draw nearer
to<br>
 the fire of life when we find it. I do not imagine that I am<br>
 worthy of you; it seems impossible that I, young, ignorant,
and<br>
 shy, could bring you one-thousandth part of the happiness that
I<br>
 drink in at the sound of your voice and the sight of you. For
me<br>
 you are the only woman in the world. I cannot imagine life
without<br>
 you, so I have made up my mind to leave France, and to risk
my<br>
 life till I lose it in some desperate enterprise, in the
Indies,<br>
 in Africa, I care not where. How can I quell a love that knows
no<br>
 limits save by opposing to it something as infinite? Yet, if
you<br>
 will allow me to hope, not to be yours, but to win your<br>
 friendship, I will stay. Let me come, not so very often, if
you<br>
 require it, to spend a few such hours with you as those
stolen<br>
 hours of yesterday. The keen delight of that brief happiness to
be<br>
 cut short at the least over-ardent word from me, will suffice
to<br>
 enable me to endure the boiling torrent in my veins. Have I<br>
 presumed too much upon your generosity by this entreaty to
suffer<br>
 an intercourse in which all the gain is mine alone? You could
find<br>
 ways of showing the world, to which you sacrifice so much, that
I<br>
 am nothing to you; you are so clever and so proud! What have
you<br>
 to fear? If I could only lay bare my heart to you at this
moment,<br>
 to convince you that it is with no lurking afterthought that
I<br>
 make this humble request! Should I have told you that my love
was<br>
 boundless, while I prayed you to grant me friendship, if I had
any<br>
 hope of your sharing this feeling in the depths of my soul?
No,<br>
 while I am with you, I will be whatever you will, if only I may
be<br>
 with you. If you refuse (as you have the power to refuse), I
will<br>
 not utter one murmur, I will go. And if, at a later day, any
other<br>
 woman should enter into my life, you will have proof that you
were<br>
 right; but if I am faithful till death, you may feel some
regret<br>
 perhaps. The hope of causing you a regret will soothe my
agony,<br>
 and that thought shall be the sole revenge of a slighted<br>
 heart. . . ."</p>

<p>Only those who have passed through all the exceeding
tribulations of<br>
 youth, who have seized on all the chimeras with two white
pinions, the<br>
 nightmare fancies at the disposal of a fervid imagination, can
realize<br>
 the horrors that seized upon Gaston de Nueil when he had reason
to<br>
 suppose that his ultimatum was in Mme. de Beauseant's hands. He
saw<br>
 the Vicomtesse, wholly untouched, laughing at his letter and his
love,<br>
 as those can laugh who have ceased to believe in love. He could
have<br>
 wished to have his letter back again. It was an absurd letter.
There<br>
 were a thousand and one things, now that he came to think of it,
that<br>
 he might have said, things infinitely better and more moving
than<br>
 those stilted phrases of his, those accursed, sophisticated,<br>
 pretentious, fine-spun phrases, though, luckily, the punctuation
had<br>
 been pretty bad and the lines shockingly crooked. He tried not
to<br>
 think, not to feel; but he felt and thought, and was wretched.
If he<br>
 had been thirty years old, he might have got drunk, but the
innocence<br>
 of three-and-twenty knew nothing of the resources of opium nor
of the<br>
 expedients of advanced civilization. Nor had he at hand one of
those<br>
 good friends of the Parisian pattern who understand so well how
to say<br>
 /Poete, non dolet!/ by producing a bottle of champagne, or
alleviate<br>
 the agony of suspense by carrying you off somewhere to make a
night of<br>
 it. Capital fellows are they, always in low water when you are
in<br>
 funds, always off to some watering-place when you go to look
them up,<br>
 always with some bad bargain in horse-flesh to sell you; it is
true,<br>
 that when you want to borrow of them, they have always just lost
their<br>
 last louis at play; but in all other respects they are the
best<br>
 fellows on earth, always ready to embark with you on one of the
steep<br>
 down-grades where you lose your time, your soul, and your
life!</p>

<p><br>
 At length M. de Nueil received a missive through the
instrumentality<br>
 of Jacques, a letter that bore the arms of Burgundy on the
scented<br>
 seal, a letter written on vellum notepaper.</p>

<p>He rushed away at once to lock himself in, and read and
re-read /her/<br>
 letter:--</p>

<p>"You are punishing me very severely, monsieur, both for
the<br>
 friendliness of my effort to spare you a rebuff, and for the<br>
 attraction which intellect always has for me. I put confidence
in<br>
 the generosity of youth, and you have disappointed me. And yet,
if<br>
 I did not speak unreservedly (which would have been
perfectly<br>
 ridiculous), at any rate I spoke frankly of my position, so
that<br>
 you might imagine that I was not to be touched by a young soul.
My<br>
 distress is the keener for my interest in you. I am
naturally<br>
 tender-hearted and kindly, but circumstances force me to act<br>
 unkindly. Another woman would have flung your letter, unread,
into<br>
 the fire; I read it, and I am answering it. My answer will make
it<br>
 clear to you that while I am not untouched by the expression
of<br>
 this feeling which I have inspired, albeit unconsciously, I
am<br>
 still far from sharing it, and the step which I am about to
take<br>
 will show you still more plainly that I mean what I say. I
wish<br>
 besides, to use, for your welfare, that authority, as it
were,<br>
 which you give me over your life; and I desire to exercise it
this<br>
 once to draw aside the veil from your eyes.</p>

<p>"I am nearly thirty years old, monsieur; you are barely
two-and-<br>
 twenty. You yourself cannot know what your thoughts will be at
my<br>
 age. The vows that you make so lightly to-day may seem a
very<br>
 heavy burden to you then. I am quite willing to believe that
at<br>
 this moment you would give me your whole life without a
regret,<br>
 you would even be ready to die for a little brief happiness;
but<br>
 at the age of thirty experience will take from you the very
power<br>
 of making daily sacrifices for my sake, and I myself should
feel<br>
 deeply humiliated if I accepted them. A day would come when<br>
 everything, even Nature, would bid you leave me, and I have<br>
 already told you that death is preferable to desertion.
Misfortune<br>
 has taught me to calculate; as you see, I am arguing
perfectly<br>
 dispassionately. You force me to tell you that I have no love
for<br>
 you; I ought not to love, I cannot, and I will not. It is too
late<br>
 to yield, as women yield, to a blind unreasoning impulse of
the<br>
 heart, too late to be the mistress whom you seek. My
consolations<br>
 spring from God, not from earth. Ah, and besides, with the<br>
 melancholy insight of disappointed love, I read hearts too
clearly<br>
 to accept your proffered friendship. It is only instinct. I<br>
 forgive the boyish ruse, for which you are not responsible as
yet.<br>
 In the name of this passing fancy of yours, for the sake of
your<br>
 career and my own peace of mind, I bid you stay in your own<br>
 country; you must not spoil a fair and honorable life for an<br>
 illusion which, by its very nature, cannot last. At a later
day,<br>
 when you have accomplished your real destiny, in the fully<br>
 developed manhood that awaits you, you will appreciate this
answer<br>
 of mine, though to-day it may be that you blame its hardness.
You<br>
 will turn with pleasure to an old woman whose friendship
will<br>
 certainly be sweet and precious to you then; a friendship
untried<br>
 by the extremes of passion and the disenchanting processes
of<br>
 life; a friendship which noble thoughts and thoughts of
religion<br>
 will keep pure and sacred. Farewell; do my bidding with the<br>
 thought that your success will bring a gleam of pleasure into
my<br>
 solitude, and only think of me as we think of absent
friends."</p>

<p>Gaston de Nueil read the letter, and wrote the following
lines:--</p>

<p>"MADAME,--If I could cease to love you, to take the chances
of<br>
 becoming an ordinary man which you hold out to me, you must
admit<br>
 that I should thoroughly deserve my fate. No, I shall not do
as<br>
 you bid me; the oath of fidelity which I swear to you shall
only<br>
 be absolved by death. Ah! take my life, unless indeed you do
not<br>
 fear to carry a remorse all through your own----"</p>

<p>When the man returned from his errand, M. de Nueil asked him
with whom<br>
 he left the note?</p>

<p>"I gave it to Mme. la Vicomtesse herself, sir; she was in her
carriage<br>
 and just about to start."</p>

<p>"For the town?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so, sir. Mme. la Vicomtesse had
post-horses."</p>

<p>"Ah! then she is going away," said the Baron.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the man answered.</p>

<p>Gaston de Nueil at once prepared to follow Mme. de Beauseant.
She led<br>
 the way as far as Geneva, without a suspicion that he followed.
And<br>
 he? Amid the many thoughts that assailed him during that
journey, one<br>
 all-absorbing problem filled his mind--"Why did she go away?"
Theories<br>
 grew thickly on such ground for supposition, and naturally he
inclined<br>
 to the one that flattered his hopes--"If the Vicomtesse cares
for me,<br>
 a clever woman would, of course, choose Switzerland, where
nobody<br>
 knows either of us, in preference to France, where she would
find<br>
 censorious critics."</p>

<p>An impassioned lover of a certain stamp would not feel
attracted to a<br>
 woman clever enough to choose her own ground; such women are
too<br>
 clever. However, there is nothing to prove that there was any
truth in<br>
 Gaston's supposition.</p>

<p>The Vicomtesse took a small house by the side of the lake. As
soon as<br>
 she was installed in it, Gaston came one summer evening in
the<br>
 twilight. Jacques, that flunkey in grain, showed no sign of
surprise,<br>
 and announced /M. le Baron de Nueil/ like a discreet domestic
well<br>
 acquainted with good society. At the sound of the name, at the
sight<br>
 of its owner, Mme. de Beauseant let her book fall from her
hands; her<br>
 surprise gave him time to come close to her, and to say in tones
that<br>
 sounded like music in her ears:</p>

<p>"What a joy it was to me to take the horses that brought you
on this<br>
 journey!"</p>

<p>To have the inmost desires of the heart so fulfilled! Where is
the<br>
 woman who could resist such happiness as this? An Italian woman,
one<br>
 of those divine creatures who, psychologically, are as far
removed<br>
 from the Parisian as if they lived at the Antipodes, a being who
would<br>
 be regarded as profoundly immoral on this side of the Alps, an
Italian<br>
 (to resume) made the following comment on some French novels
which she<br>
 had been reading. "I cannot see," she remarked, "why these poor
lovers<br>
 take such a time over coming to an arrangement which ought to be
the<br>
 affair of a single morning." Why should not the novelist take a
hint<br>
 from this worthy lady, and refrain from exhausting the theme and
the<br>
 reader? Some few passages of coquetry it would certainly be
pleasant<br>
 to give in outline; the story of Mme. de Beauseant's demurs and
sweet<br>
 delayings, that, like the vestal virgins of antiquity, she might
fall<br>
 gracefully, and by lingering over the innocent raptures of first
love<br>
 draw from it its utmost strength and sweetness. M. de Nueil was
at an<br>
 age when a man is the dupe of these caprices, of the fence which
women<br>
 delight to prolong; either to dictate their own terms, or to
enjoy the<br>
 sense of their power yet longer, knowing instinctively as they
do that<br>
 it must soon grow less. But, after all, these little boudoir<br>
 protocols, less numerous than those of the Congress of London,
are too<br>
 small to be worth mention in the history of this passion.</p>

<p>For three years Mme. de Beauseant and M. de Nueil lived in the
villa<br>
 on the lake of Geneva. They lived quite alone, received no
visitors,<br>
 caused no talk, rose late, went out together upon the lake,
knew, in<br>
 short, the happiness of which we all of us dream. It was a
simple<br>
 little house, with green shutters, and broad balconies shaded
with<br>
 awnings, a house contrived of set purpose for lovers, with its
white<br>
 couches, soundless carpets, and fresh hangings, everything
within it<br>
 reflecting their joy. Every window looked out on some new view
of the<br>
 lake; in the far distance lay the mountains, fantastic visions
of<br>
 changing color and evanescent cloud; above them spread the sunny
sky,<br>
 before them stretched the broad sheet of water, never the same
in its<br>
 fitful changes. All their surroundings seemed to dream for them,
all<br>
 things smiled upon them.</p>

<p>Then weighty matters recalled M. de Nueil to France. His
father and<br>
 brother died, and he was obliged to leave Geneva. The lovers
bought<br>
 the house; and if they could have had their way, they would
have<br>
 removed the hills piecemeal, drawn off the lake with a siphon,
and<br>
 taken everything away with them.</p>

<p><br>
 Mme. de Beauseant followed M. de Nueil. She realized her
property, and<br>
 bought a considerable estate near Manerville, adjoining
Gaston's<br>
 lands, and here they lived together; Gaston very graciously
giving up<br>
 Manerville to his mother for the present in consideration of
the<br>
 bachelor freedom in which she left him.</p>

<p>Mme. de Beauseant's estate was close to a little town in one
of the<br>
 most picturesque spots in the valley of the Auge. Here the
lovers<br>
 raised barriers between themselves and social intercourse,
barriers<br>
 which no creature could overleap, and here the happy days of<br>
 Switzerland were lived over again. For nine whole years they
knew<br>
 happiness which it serves no purpose to describe; happiness
which may<br>
 be divined from the outcome of the story by those whose souls
can<br>
 comprehend poetry and prayer in their infinite
manifestations.</p>

<p>All this time Mme. de Beauseant's husband, the present Marquis
(his<br>
 father and elder brother having died), enjoyed the soundest
health.<br>
 There is no better aid to life than a certain knowledge that
our<br>
 demise would confer a benefit on some fellow-creature. M. de
Beauseant<br>
 was one of those ironical and wayward beings who, like holders
of<br>
 life-annuities, wake with an additional sense of relish every
morning<br>
 to a consciousness of good health. For the rest, he was a man of
the<br>
 world, somewhat methodical and ceremonious, and a calculator
of<br>
 consequences, who could make a declaration of love as quietly as
a<br>
 lackey announces that "Madame is served."</p>

<p>This brief biographical notice of his lordship the Marquis
de<br>
 Beauseant is given to explain the reasons why it was impossible
for<br>
 the Marquise to marry M. de Nueil.</p>

<p>So, after a nine years' lease of happiness, the sweetest
agreement to<br>
 which a woman ever put her hand, M. de Nueil and Mme. de
Beauseant<br>
 were still in a position quite as natural and quite as false as
at the<br>
 beginning of their adventure. And yet they had reached a fatal
crisis,<br>
 which may be stated as clearly as any problem in
mathematics.</p>

<p>Mme. la Comtesse de Nueil, Gaston's mother, a strait-laced
and<br>
 virtuous person, who had made the late Baron happy in strictly
legal<br>
 fashion would never consent to meet Mme. de Beauseant. Mme.
de<br>
 Beauseant quite understood that the worthy dowager must of
necessity<br>
 be her enemy, and that she would try to draw Gaston from his<br>
 unhallowed and immoral way of life. The Marquise de Beauseant
would<br>
 willingly have sold her property and gone back to Geneva, but
she<br>
 could not bring herself to do it; it would mean that she
distrusted M.<br>
 de Nueil. Moreover, he had taken a great fancy to this very
Valleroy<br>
 estate, where he was making plantations and improvements. She
would<br>
 not deprive him of a piece of pleasurable routine-work, such as
women<br>
 always wish for their husbands, and even for their lovers.</p>

<p>A Mlle. de la Rodiere, twenty-two years of age, an heiress
with a<br>
 rent-roll of forty thousand livres, had come to live in the<br>
 neighborhood. Gaston always met her at Manerville whenever he
was<br>
 obliged to go thither. These various personages being to each
other as<br>
 the terms of a proportion sum, the following letter will throw
light<br>
 on the appalling problem which Mme. de Beauseant had been trying
for<br>
 the past month to solve:--</p>

<p>"My beloved angel, it seems like nonsense, does it not, to
write<br>
 to you when there is nothing to keep us apart, when a caress
so<br>
 often takes the place of words, and words too are caresses?
Ah,<br>
 well, no, love. There are some things that a woman cannot say
when<br>
 she is face to face with the man she loves; at the bare thought
of<br>
 them her voice fails her, and the blood goes back to her
heart;<br>
 she has no strength, no intelligence left. It hurts me to
feel<br>
 like this when you are near me, and it happens often. I feel
that<br>
 my heart should be wholly sincere for you; that I should
disguise<br>
 no thought, however transient, in my heart; and I love the
sweet<br>
 carelessness, which suits me so well, too much to endure
this<br>
 embarrassment and constraint any longer. So I will tell you
about<br>
 my anguish--yes, it is anguish. Listen to me! do not begin
with<br>
 the little 'Tut, tut, tut,' that you use to silence me, an<br>
 impertinence that I love, because anything from you pleases
me.<br>
 Dear soul from heaven, wedded to mine, let me first tell you
that<br>
 you have effaced all memory of the pain that once was crushing
the<br>
 life out of me. I did not know what love was before I knew
you.<br>
 Only the candor of your beautiful young life, only the purity
of<br>
 that great soul of yours, could satisfy the requirements of
an<br>
 exacting woman's heart. Dear love, how very often I have
thrilled<br>
 with joy to think that in these nine long, swift years, my<br>
 jealousy has not been once awakened. All the flowers of your
soul<br>
 have been mine, all your thoughts. There has not been the
faintest<br>
 cloud in our heaven; we have not known what sacrifice is; we
have<br>
 always acted on the impulses of our hearts. I have known<br>
 happiness, infinite for a woman. Will the tears that drench
this<br>
 sheet tell you all my gratitude? I could wish that I had knelt
to<br>
 write the words!--Well, out of this felicity has arisen
torture<br>
 more terrible than the pain of desertion. Dear, there are
very<br>
 deep recesses in a woman's heart; how deep in my own heart, I
did<br>
 not know myself until to-day, as I did not know the whole
extent<br>
 of love. The greatest misery which could overwhelm us is a
light<br>
 burden compared with the mere thought of harm for him whom
we<br>
 love. And how if we cause the harm, is it not enough to make
one<br>
 die? . . . This is the thought that is weighing upon me. But<br>
 it brings in its train another thought that is heavier far,
a<br>
 thought that tarnishes the glory of love, and slays it, and
turns<br>
 it into a humiliation which sullies life as long as it lasts.
You<br>
 are thirty years old; I am forty. What dread this difference
in<br>
 age calls up in a woman who loves! It is possible that, first
of<br>
 all unconsciously, afterwards in earnest, you have felt the<br>
 sacrifices that you have made by renouncing all in the world
for<br>
 me. Perhaps you have thought of your future from the social
point<br>
 of view, of the marriage which would, of course, increase
your<br>
 fortune, and give you avowed happiness and children who
would<br>
 inherit your wealth; perhaps you have thought of reappearing
in<br>
 the world, and filling your place there honorably. And then,
if<br>
 so, you must have repressed those thoughts, and felt glad to<br>
 sacrifice heiress and fortune and a fair future to me without
my<br>
 knowledge. In your young man's generosity, you must have
resolved<br>
 to be faithful to the vows which bind us each to each in the
sight<br>
 of God. My past pain has risen up before your mind, and the
misery<br>
 from which you rescued me has been my protection. To owe your
love<br>
 to your pity! The thought is even more painful to me than the
fear<br>
 of spoiling your life for you. The man who can bring himself
to<br>
 stab his mistress is very charitable if he gives her her
deathblow<br>
 while she is happy and ignorant of evil, while illusions are
in<br>
 full blossom. . . . Yes, death is preferable to the two
thoughts<br>
 which have secretly saddened the hours for several days.
To-day,<br>
 when you asked 'What ails you?' so tenderly, the sound of
your<br>
 voice made me shiver. I thought that, after your wont, you
were<br>
 reading my very soul, and I waited for your confidence to
come,<br>
 thinking that my presentiments had come true, and that I had<br>
 guessed all that was going on in your mind. Then I began to
think<br>
 over certain little things that you always do for me, and I<br>
 thought I could see in you the sort of affection by which a
man<br>
 betrays a consciousness that his loyalty is becoming a burden.
And<br>
 in that moment I paid very dear for my happiness. I felt
that<br>
 Nature always demands the price for the treasure called
love.<br>
 Briefly, has not fate separated us? Can you have said, 'Sooner
or<br>
 later I must leave poor Claire; why not separate in time?' I
read<br>
 that thought in the depths of your eyes, and went away to cry
by<br>
 myself. Hiding my tears from you! the first tears that I have
shed<br>
 for sorrow for these ten years; I am too proud to let you
see<br>
 them, but I did not reproach you in the least.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right. I ought not to be so selfish as to bind
your<br>
 long and brilliant career to my so-soon out-worn life. . . .
And<br>
 yet--how if I have been mistaken? How if I have taken your
love<br>
 melancholy for a deliberation? Oh, my love, do not leave me
in<br>
 suspense; punish this jealous wife of yours, but give her back
the<br>
 sense of her love and yours; the whole woman lies in
that--that<br>
 consciousness sanctifies everything.</p>

<br>
"Since your mother came, since you paid a visit to Mlle. de<br>
Rodiere, I have been gnawed by doubts dishonoring to us both.
Make<br>
me suffer for this, but do not deceive me; I want to know<br>
everything that your mother said and that you think! If you
have<br>
hesitated between some alternative and me, I give you back
your<br>
liberty. . . . I will not let you know what happens to me; I
will<br>
not shed tears for you to see; only--I will not see you
again.<br>
. . . Ah! I cannot go on, my heart is breaking . . . . . . . . .
.<br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I have been
sitting<br>
benumbed and stupid for some moments. Dear love, I do not
find<br>
that any feeling of pride rises against you; you are so kind-<br>
hearted, so open; you would find it impossible to hurt me or
to<br>
deceive me; and you will tell me the truth, however cruel it
may<br>
be. Do you wish me to encourage your confession? Well, then,
heart<br>
of mine, I shall find comfort in a woman's thought. Has not
the<br>
youth of your being been mine, your sensitive, wholly
gracious,<br>
beautiful, and delicate youth? No woman shall find henceforth
the<br>
Gaston whom I have known, nor the delicious happiness that he
has<br>
given me. . . . No; you will never love again as you have
loved,<br>
as you love me now; no, I shall never have a rival, it is<br>
impossible. There will be no bitterness in my memories of our<br>
love, and I shall think of nothing else. It is out of your
power<br>
to enchant any woman henceforth by the childish provocations,
the<br>
charming ways of a young heart, the soul's winning charm, the<br>
body's grace, the swift communion of rapture, the whole
divine<br>
cortege of young love, in fine. 

<p>"Oh, you are a man now, you will obey your destiny, weighing
and<br>
 considering all things. You will have cares, and anxieties,
and<br>
 ambitions, and concerns that will rob /her/ of the
unchanging<br>
 smile that made your lips fair for me. The tones that were
always<br>
 so sweet for me will be troubled at times; and your eyes
that<br>
 lighted up with radiance from heaven at the sight of me,
will<br>
 often be lustreless for /her/. And besides, as it is impossible
to<br>
 love you as I love you, you will never care for that woman as
you<br>
 have cared for me. She will never keep a constant watch over<br>
 herself as I have done; she will never study your happiness
at<br>
 every moment with an intuition which has never failed me. Ah,
yes,<br>
 the man, the heart and soul, which I shall have known will
exist<br>
 no longer. I shall bury him deep in my memory, that I may have
the<br>
 joy of him still; I shall live happy in that fair past life
of<br>
 ours, a life hidden from all but our inmost selves.</p>

<p>"Dear treasure of mine, if all the while no least thought
of<br>
 liberty has risen in your mind, if my love is no burden on you,
if<br>
 my fears are chimerical, if I am still your Eve--the one woman
in<br>
 the world for you--come to me as soon as you have read this<br>
 letter, come quickly! Ah, in one moment I will love you more
than<br>
 I have ever loved you, I think, in these nine years. After<br>
 enduring the needless torture of these doubts of which I am<br>
 accusing myself, every added day of love, yes, every single
day,<br>
 will be a whole lifetime of bliss. So speak, and speak openly;
do<br>
 not deceive me, it would be a crime. Tell me, do you wish for
your<br>
 liberty? Have you thought of all that a man's life means? Is
there<br>
 any regret in your mind? That /I/ should cause you a regret!
I<br>
 should die of it. I have said it: I love you enough to set
your<br>
 happiness above mine, your life before my own. Leave on one
side,<br>
 if you can, the wealth of memories of our nine years'
happiness,<br>
 that they may not influence your decision, but speak! I
submit<br>
 myself to you as to God, the one Consoler who remains if you<br>
 forsake me."</p>

<p>When Mme. de Beauseant knew that her letter was in M. de
Nueil's<br>
 hands, she sank in such utter prostration, the over-pressure of
many<br>
 thoughts so numbed her faculties, that she seemed almost drowsy.
At<br>
 any rate, she was suffering from a pain not always proportioned
in its<br>
 intensity to a woman's strength; pain which women alone know.
And<br>
 while the unhappy Marquise awaited her doom, M. de Nueil,
reading her<br>
 letter, felt that he was "in a very difficult position," to use
the<br>
 expression that young men apply to a crisis of this kind.</p>

<p>By this time he had all but yielded to his mother's
importunities and<br>
 to the attractions of Mlle. de la Rodiere, a somewhat
insignificant,<br>
 pink-and-white young person, as straight as a poplar. It is true
that,<br>
 in accordance with the rules laid down for marriageable young
ladies,<br>
 she scarcely opened her mouth, but her rent-roll of forty
thousand<br>
 livres spoke quite sufficiently for her. Mme. de Nueil, with
a<br>
 mother's sincere affection, tried to entangle her son in
virtuous<br>
 courses. She called his attention to the fact that it was a
flattering<br>
 distinction to be preferred by Mlle. de la Rodiere, who had
refused so<br>
 many great matches; it was quite time, she urged, that he should
think<br>
 of his future, such a good opportunity might not repeat itself,
some<br>
 day he would have eighty thousand livres of income from land;
money<br>
 made everything bearable; if Mme. de Beauseant loved him for his
own<br>
 sake, she ought to be the first to urge him to marry. In short,
the<br>
 well-intentioned mother forgot no arguments which the
feminine<br>
 intellect can bring to bear upon the masculine mind, and by
these<br>
 means she had brought her son into a wavering condition.</p>

<p>Mme. de Beauseant's letter arrived just as Gaston's love of
her was<br>
 holding out against the temptations of a settled life
conformable to<br>
 received ideas. That letter decided the day. He made up his mind
to<br>
 break off with the Marquise and to marry.</p>

<p>"One must live a man's life," said he to himself.</p>

<p>Then followed some inkling of the pain that this decision
would give<br>
 to Mme. de Beauseant. The man's vanity and the lover's
conscience<br>
 further exaggerated this pain, and a sincere pity for her seized
upon<br>
 him. All at once the immensity of the misery became apparent to
him,<br>
 and he thought it necessary and charitable to deaden the deadly
blow.<br>
 He hoped to bring Mme. de Beauseant to a calm frame of mind
by<br>
 gradually reconciling her to the idea of separation; while Mlle.
de la<br>
 Rodiere, always like a shadowy third between them, should be<br>
 sacrificed to her at first, only to be imposed upon her later.
His<br>
 marriage should take place later, in obedience to Mme. de
Beauseant's<br>
 expressed wish. He went so far as to enlist the Marquise's
nobleness<br>
 and pride and all the great qualities of her nature to help him
to<br>
 succeed in this compassionate design. He would write a letter at
once<br>
 to allay her suspicions. /A letter!/ For a woman with the
most<br>
 exquisite feminine perception, as well as the intuition of
passionate<br>
 love, a letter in itself was a sentence of death.</p>

<p>So when Jacques came and brought Mme. de Beauseant a sheet of
paper<br>
 folded in a triangle, she trembled, poor woman, like a snared
swallow.<br>
 A mysterious sensation of physical cold spread from head to
foot,<br>
 wrapping her about in an icy winding sheet. If he did not rush
to her<br>
 feet, if he did not come to her in tears, and pale, and like a
lover,<br>
 she knew that all was lost. And yet, so many hopes are there in
the<br>
 heart of a woman who loves, that she is only slain by stab after
stab,<br>
 and loves on till the last drop of life-blood drains away.</p>

<p>"Does madame need anything?" Jacques asked gently, as he went
away.</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" she thought, brushing a tear from her eyes, "he
guesses<br>
 my feelings, servant though he is!"</p>

<p>She read: "My beloved, you are inventing idle terrors for<br>
 yourself . . ." The Marquise gazed at the words, and a thick
mist<br>
 spread before her eyes. A voice in her heart cried, "He
lies!"--Then<br>
 she glanced down the page with the clairvoyant eagerness of
passion,<br>
 and read these words at the foot, "/Nothing has been decided
as<br>
 yet . . ./" Turning to the other side with convulsive quickness,
she<br>
 saw the mind of the writer distinctly through the intricacies of
the<br>
 wording; this was no spontaneous outburst of love. She crushed
it in<br>
 her fingers, twisted it, tore it with her teeth, flung it in the
fire,<br>
 and cried aloud, "Ah! base that he is! I was his, and he had
ceased to<br>
 love me!"</p>

<br>
She sank half dead upon the couch. 

<p>M. de Nueil went out as soon as he had written his letter.
When he<br>
 came back, Jacques met him on the threshold with a note. "Madame
la<br>
 Marquise has left the chateau," said the man.</p>

<p>M. de Nueil, in amazement, broke the seal and read:--</p>

<p>"MADAME,--If I could cease to love you, to take the chances
of<br>
 becoming an ordinary man which you hold out to me, you must
admit<br>
 that I should thoroughly deserve my fate. No, I shall not do
as<br>
 you bid me; the oath of fidelity which I swear to you shall
only<br>
 be absolved by death. Ah! take my life, unless indeed you do
not<br>
 fear to carry a remorse all through your own . . ."</p>

<p>It was his own letter, written to the Marquise as she set out
for<br>
 Geneva nine years before. At the foot of it Claire de Bourgogne
had<br>
 written, "Monsieur, you are free."</p>

<p>M. de Nueil went to his mother at Manerville. In less than
three weeks<br>
 he married Mlle. Stephanie de la Rodiere.</p>

<p>If this commonplace story of real life ended here, it would be
to some<br>
 extent a sort of mystification. The first man you meet can tell
you a<br>
 better. But the widespread fame of the catastrophe (for,
unhappily,<br>
 this is a true tale), and all the memories which it may arouse
in<br>
 those who have known the divine delights of infinite passion,
and lost<br>
 them by their own deed, or through the cruelty of fate,--these
things<br>
 may perhaps shelter the story from criticism.</p>

<p>Mme. la Marquise de Beauseant never left Valleroy after her
parting<br>
 from M. de Nueil. After his marriage she still continued to
live<br>
 there, for some inscrutable woman's reason; any woman is at
liberty to<br>
 assign the one which most appeals to her. Claire de Bourgogne
lived in<br>
 such complete retirement that none of the servants, save Jacques
and<br>
 her own woman, ever saw their mistress. She required absolute
silence<br>
 all about her, and only left her room to go to the chapel on
the<br>
 Valleroy estate, whither a neighboring priest came to say mass
every<br>
 morning.</p>

<p>The Comte de Nueil sank a few days after his marriage into
something<br>
 like conjugal apathy, which might be interpreted to mean
happiness or<br>
 unhappiness equally easily.</p>

<p>"My son is perfectly happy," his mother said everywhere.</p>

<p>Mme. Gaston de Nueil, like a great many young women, was a
rather<br>
 colorless character, sweet and passive. A month after her
marriage she<br>
 had expectations of becoming a mother. All this was quite in<br>
 accordance with ordinary views. M. de Nueil was very nice to
her; but<br>
 two months after his separation from the Marquise, he grew
notably<br>
 thoughtful and abstracted. But then he always had been serious,
his<br>
 mother said.</p>

<p>After seven months of this tepid happiness, a little thing
occurred,<br>
 one of those seemingly small matters which imply such great<br>
 development of thought and such widespread trouble of the soul,
that<br>
 only the bare fact can be recorded; the interpretation of it
must be<br>
 left to the fancy of each individual mind. One day, when M. de
Nueil<br>
 had been shooting over the lands of Manerville and Valleroy,
he<br>
 crossed Mme. de Beauseant's park on his way home, summoned
Jacques,<br>
 and when the man came, asked him, "Whether the Marquise was as
fond of<br>
 game as ever?"</p>

<p>Jacques answering in the affirmative, Gaston offered him a
good round<br>
 sum (accompanied by plenty of specious reasoning) for a very
little<br>
 service. Would he set aside for the Marquise the game that the
Count<br>
 would bring? It seemed to Jacques to be a matter of no great<br>
 importance whether the partridge on which his mistress dined had
been<br>
 shot by her keeper or by M. de Nueil, especially since the
latter<br>
 particularly wished that the Marquise should know nothing about
it.</p>

<p>"It was killed on her land," said the Count, and for some days
Jacques<br>
 lent himself to the harmless deceit. Day after day M. de Nueil
went<br>
 shooting, and came back at dinner-time with an empty bag. A
whole week<br>
 went by in this way. Gaston grew bold enough to write a long
letter to<br>
 the Marquise, and had it conveyed to her. It was returned to
him<br>
 unopened. The Marquise's servant brought it back about
nightfall. The<br>
 Count, sitting in the drawing-room listening, while his wife at
the<br>
 piano mangled a /Caprice/ of Herold's, suddenly sprang up and
rushed<br>
 out to the Marquise, as if he were flying to an assignation. He
dashed<br>
 through a well-known gap into the park, and went slowly along
the<br>
 avenues, stopping now and again for a little to still the loud
beating<br>
 of his heart. Smothered sounds as he came nearer the chateau
told him<br>
 that the servants must be at supper, and he went straight to
Mme. de<br>
 Beauseant's room.</p>

<p>Mme. de Beauseant never left her bedroom. M. de Nueil could
gain the<br>
 doorway without making the slightest sound. There, by the light
of two<br>
 wax candles, he saw the thin, white Marquise in a great
armchair; her<br>
 head was bowed, her hands hung listlessly, her eyes gazing
fixedly at<br>
 some object which she did not seem to see. Her whole attitude
spoke of<br>
 hopeless pain. There was a vague something like hope in her
bearing,<br>
 but it was impossible to say whither Claire de Bourgogne was
looking--<br>
 forwards to the tomb or backwards into the past. Perhaps M. de
Nueil's<br>
 tears glittered in the deep shadows; perhaps his breathing
sounded<br>
 faintly; perhaps unconsciously he trembled, or again it may have
been<br>
 impossible that he should stand there, his presence unfelt by
that<br>
 quick sense which grows to be an instinct, the glory, the
delight, the<br>
 proof of perfect love. However it was, Mme. de Beauseant slowly
turned<br>
 her face towards the doorway, and beheld her lover of bygone
days.<br>
 Then Gaston de Nueil came forward a few paces.</p>

<p>"If you come any further, sir," exclaimed the Marquise,
growing paler,<br>
 "I shall fling myself out of the window!"</p>

<p>She sprang to the window, flung it open, and stood with one
foot on<br>
 the ledge, her hand upon the iron balustrade, her face turned
towards<br>
 Gaston.</p>

<p>"Go out! go out!" she cried, "or I will throw myself
over."</p>

<p>At that dreadful cry the servants began to stir, and M. de
Nueil fled<br>
 like a criminal.</p>

<p>When he reached his home again he wrote a few lines and gave
them to<br>
 his own man, telling him to give the letter himself into Mme.
de<br>
 Beauseant's hands, and to say that it was a matter of life and
death<br>
 for his master. The messenger went. M. de Nueil went back to
the<br>
 drawing-room where his wife was still murdering the /Caprice/,
and sat<br>
 down to wait till the answer came. An hour later, when the
/Caprice/<br>
 had come to an end, and the husband and wife sat in silence
on<br>
 opposite sides of the hearth, the man came back from Valleroy
and gave<br>
 his master his own letter, unopened.</p>

<p>M. de Nueil went into a small room beyond the drawing-room,
where he<br>
 had left his rifle, and shot himself.</p>

<p>The swift and fatal ending of the drama, contrary as it is to
all the<br>
 habits of young France, is only what might have been expected.
Those<br>
 who have closely observed, or known for themselves by
delicious<br>
 experience, all that is meant by the perfect union of two
beings, will<br>
 understand Gaston de Nueil's suicide perfectly well. A woman
does not<br>
 bend and form herself in a day to the caprices of passion.
The<br>
 pleasure of loving, like some rare flower, needs the most
careful<br>
 ingenuity of culture. Time alone, and two souls attuned each to
each,<br>
 can discover all its resources, and call into being all the
tender and<br>
 delicate delights for which we are steeped in a thousand<br>
 superstitions, imagining them to be inherent in the heart
that<br>
 lavishes them upon us. It is this wonderful response of one
nature to<br>
 another, this religious belief, this certainty of finding
peculiar or<br>
 excessive happiness in the presence of one we love, that
accounts in<br>
 part for perdurable attachments and long-lived passion. If a
woman<br>
 possesses the genius of her sex, love never comes to be a matter
of<br>
 use and wont. She brings all her heart and brain to love,
clothes her<br>
 tenderness in forms so varied, there is such art in her most
natural<br>
 moments, or so much nature in her art, that in absence her
memory is<br>
 almost as potent as her presence. All other women are as
shadows<br>
 compared with her. Not until we have lost or known the dread of
losing<br>
 a love so vast and glorious, do we prize it at its just worth.
And if<br>
 a man who has once possessed this love shuts himself out from it
by<br>
 his own act and deed, and sinks to some loveless marriage; if by
some<br>
 incident, hidden in the obscurity of married life, the woman
with whom<br>
 he hoped to know the same felicity makes it clear that it will
never<br>
 be revived for him; if, with the sweetness of divine love still
on his<br>
 lips, he has dealt a deadly wound to /her/, his wife in truth,
whom he<br>
 forsook for a social chimera,--then he must either die or take
refuge<br>
 in a materialistic, selfish, and heartless philosophy, from
which<br>
 impassioned souls shrink in horror.</p>

<p>As for Mme. de Beauseant, she doubtless did not imagine that
her<br>
 friend's despair could drive him to suicide, when he had drunk
deep of<br>
 love for nine years. Possibly she may have thought that she
alone was<br>
 to suffer. At any rate, she did quite rightly to refuse the
most<br>
 humiliating of all positions; a wife may stoop for weighty
social<br>
 reasons to a kind of compromise which a mistress is bound to
hold in<br>
 abhorrence, for in the purity of her passion lies all its<br>
 justification.</p>
